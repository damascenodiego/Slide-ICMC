We extend a known lower bound on membership queries to the case of randomized learning algorithms, and prove lower bounds on the number of alternations between membership and equivalence queries. We also show that a trade-off exists, allowing us to reduce the number of equivalence queries at the price of increasing the number of membership queries.",

abstract="The problems of active inference (learning) and conformance testing of a system modelled by an automaton have actively been studied for decades, however, much less attention has been paid to modular systems, modelled by communicating automata. In this paper, we consider a system of two communicating FSMs, one machine represents an embedded component and another the remaining part of the system, the context. Assuming that the context FSM is known, we want to learn the embedded FSM without directly interacting with it. This problem can be viewed as a generalization of the classical automata inference in isolation, i.e., it is the grey box learning problem. The proposed approach to solve this problem relies on a SAT-solving method for FSM inference from traces. It does not depend on the composition topology and allows at the same time to solve a related problem of conformance testing in context. The latter is to test whether an embedded implementation FSM composed with the given context is equivalent to the embedded specification FSM also composed with the context. The novelty of the conformance testing method is that it directly generates a complete test suite for the embedded machine and avoids using nondeterministic approximations with their tests, eliminating thus several sources of test redundancy inherent in the existing methods.",

This paper proposes a novel method for learning a behavioral model of car-following using automata learning algorithms. The model is interpretable for car-following behavior analysis. Frequent common state sequences are extracted from the model and clustered as driving patterns. The Next Generation SIMulation dataset on the I-80 highway is used for learning and evaluating. The experimental results demonstrate high accuracy of car-following model fitting."

The used technique interacts with a running component and extracts abstract models that would help developers make better informed decisions. As promising in theory, as slippery in application it is, however. This report describes our experience in applying model learning to legacy software, and aims to prepare the newcomer for what shady pitfalls lie therein as well as provide the seasoned researcher with concrete cases and open problems.

It is assumed that the regular set is presented by a minimally adequate Teacher, which can answer membership queries about the set and can also test a conjecture and indicate whether it is equal to the unknown set and provide a counterexample if not. (A counterexample is a string in the symmetric difference of the correct set and the conjectured set.) A learning algorithm L∗ is described that correctly learns any regular set from any minimally adequate Teacher in time polynomial in the number of states of the minimum dfa for the set and the maximum length of any counterexample provided by the Teacher. It is shown that in a stochastic setting the ability of the Teacher to test conjectures may be replaced by a random sampling oracle, EX( ). A polynomial-time learning algorithm is shown for a particular problem of context-free language identification."

The essential steps and the impact of TTT are illustrated via experimentation with LearnLib, a free, open source Java library for active automata learning.",

abstract="This paper presents an automated and compositional procedure to solve the substitutability problem in the context of evolving software systems. Our solution contributes two techniques for checking correctness of software upgrades: (1) a technique based on simultaneous use of over-and under-approximations obtained via existential and universal abstractions; (2) a dynamic assume-guarantee reasoning algorithm---previously generated component assumptions are reused and altered on-the-fly to prove or disprove the global safety properties on the updated system. When upgrades are found to be non-substitutable, our solution generates constructive feedback to developers showing how to improve the components. The substitutability approach has been implemented and validated in the ComFoRT reasoning framework, and we report encouraging results on an industrial benchmark.",

abstract="Test-based model generation by classical automata learning is very expensive. It requires an impractically large number of queries to the system, each of which must be implemented as a system-level test case. Key in the tractability of observation-based model generation are powerful optimizations exploiting different kinds of expert knowledge in order to drastically reduce the number of required queries, and thus the testing effort. In this paper, we present a thorough experimental analysis of the second-order effects between such optimizations in order to maximize their combined impact.",

abstract="Automatically generated models may provide the key towards controlling the evolution of complex systems, form the basis for test generation and may be applied as monitors for running applications. However, the practicality of automata learning is currently largely preempted by its extremely high complexity and unrealistic frame conditions. By optimizing a standard learning method according to domain-specific structural properties, we are able to generate abstract models for complex reactive systems. The experiments conducted using an industry-level test environment on a recent version of a telephone switch illustrate the drastic effect of our optimizations on the learning efficiency. From a conceptual point of view, the developments can be seen as an instance of optimizing general learning procedures by capitalizing on specific application profiles.",

This approach enables direct observation of the automata construction process: the learning algorithm continues to complete its hypothesis, providing intuition to a field of formal methods otherwise dominated by algorithms that largely operate on internal data structures without visible feedback.",

abstract="In this paper we present TTT, a novel active automata learning algorithm formulated in the Minimally Adequate Teacher (MAT) framework. The distinguishing characteristic of TTT is its redundancy-free organization of observations, which can be exploited to achieve optimal (linear) space complexity. This is thanks to a thorough analysis of counterexamples, extracting and storing only the essential refining information. TTT is therefore particularly well-suited for application in a runtime verification context, where counterexamples (obtained, e.g., via monitoring) may be excessively long: as the execution time of a test sequence typically grows with its length, this would otherwise cause severe performance degradation. We illustrate the impact of TTT's consequent redundancy-free approach along a number of examples.",
